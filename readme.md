# Star Wars - Fleet Command

## Preamble
Hello Commander! Welcome to fleet command. With the full might of the New Galactic Empire at your disposal, you will need to assemble a fleet to scour the stars to wipe out the Jedi plague.

### Fleet Command
- You should see a form in front of you, in it. You will see a selection of fine ships that you currently have access to, ranging from the lowly Corvette to the magnificent Death Star! As someone held in such high regard, money is no longer an issue, tell us what you want and we shall see it done! We'll add it to the back log and it will be made available to you... Eventually... Glory to the Empire! 

### Starship Details
- At this point you've spent all this time picking out ships, but surely you need to refresh your memory from time to time. Simply select a ship by clicking on it and watch as the information fills the display.
